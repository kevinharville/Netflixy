Thank you for reviewing my project!

I considered a few things that I did not implement as they were not requirements:

1. The Google format images do not work in all browsers and since they are delivered via the cdn I 
did not address that.  Please choose chrome as they areto match them Google format.
I would save them into Photoshop and save them as png files and either deliver browser-
specific files or the pngs, depending on the relative file sizes.

2. There was no requirement to remove the recommendations when chosen.  It would be a consideration 
but not a necessity.

3. On removing favorites, I could remove the element's matching mylist object.  Currently that does 
not affect functionality.
